<h1>Java LeetCode Collections</h1>

<p>To build and run this project, you need to have the following tools installed</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Java Development Kit (JDK)</li>
   <li>Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
   <li>
      Clone or download the repository to your local machine
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Nitzantomer1998/LeetCode.git</code></pre>
   </li>
   <li>Open the project in your preferred Java IDE</li>
   <li>Import the desired algorithm and use it in your project</li>
</ol>

<h2>Study Plans</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Algorithm: Algorithm I</li>
   <li>More Study Plans will be solved and uploaded over time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
   <li>The repository may not include all possible problems found on LeetCode</li>
   <li>Solutions may not always be the most optimal or efficient, as I improve over time</li>
   <li>The algorithms have been implemented for educational purposes and may not be suitable for use in production environments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Add more problems and solutions</li>
   <li>Add solutions for additional Study Plans</li>
   <li>Improve the explanations and comments in the solutions</li>
   <li>Include alternative solutions and provide in-depth analysis of time and space complexity</li>
</ul>
