<h1>LeetCode</h1>
<p>
   This repository contains a collection of LeetCode algorithm problems solution.<br>
   The algorithms are from wide range of "Study Plans" including: Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Data Structures, etc.<br>
   This repository is aimed to improve and test my problem solving skills in problem solving.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Navitage into the desired Language</p>

<h3>Available Langauges</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Python</li>
   <li>JavaScript</li>
   <li>C</li>
</ul>

<h2>Available Study Planes</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Algorithm: Algorithm I, Algorithm II</li>
   <li>Dynamic Programming: Dynamic Programming I</li>
   <li>With time more Study Planes will be solved and upload</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
   <li>The repository may not include all possible problems found on LeetCode</li>
   <li>Solutions may not always be the most optimal or efficient, as i improve with time</li>
   <li>The algorithms have been implemented for educational purposes and may not be suitable for use in production environments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future improvements</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Add more problems and solutions</li>
   <li>Add more Study Planes solutions</li>
   <li>Improve the explanations and comments in the solutions</li>
   <li>Include alternative solutions and time/space complexity indepth analysis</li>
</ul>
