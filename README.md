<h1>LeetCode</h1>
<p>
   This repository contains a collection of LeetCode algorithm problems solution in Python.<br>
   The algorithms are from wide range of "Study Plans" including: Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Data Structures, etc.<br>
   This repository is aimed to improve and test my problem solving skills in problem solving.

   <b>Note: You might need to change algorithms name / parameters and such, as i work according to python PEP8, and not LeetCode</b>
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
   To use the algorithms, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. The repository is compatible with Python 3.x.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Python 3.x</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Clone or download the repository to your local machine</li>
   
   <pre>
      $ git clone https://github.com/Nitzantomer1998/LeetCode.git
   </pre>
  
   <li>Open the project in your preferred IDE</li>
   <li>Import the desired algorithm and use it in your project</li>
</ol>

<h2>Study Planes</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Algorithm: Algorithm I, Algorithm II</li>
   <li>Dynamic Programming: Dynamic Programming I</li>
   <li>With time more Study Planes will be solved and upload</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
   <li>The repository may not include all possible problems found on LeetCode</li>
   <li>Solutions may not always be the most optimal or efficient, as i improve with time</li>
   <li>The algorithms have been implemented for educational purposes and may not be suitable for use in production environments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future improvements</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Add more problems and solutions</li>
   <li>Add more Study Planes solutions</li>
   <li>Improve the explanations and comments in the solutions</li>
   <li>Include alternative solutions and time/space complexity indepth analysis</li>
</ul>
